# Water-jug-problem
 
- In the water jug problem in Artificial Intelligence,  provided two jugs: 
- one having the capacity to hold 3 gallons of water and the other has the capacity to hold 4 gallons of water.
- There is no other measuring equipment available and the jugs also do not have any kind of marking on them. So, the agentâ€™s task here is to fill the 4-gallon jug with 2 gallons of water by using only these two jugs and no other material. Initially, both our jugs are empty.
 
 ## Production rules for solving the water jug problem
Here, let x denote the 4-gallon jug and y denote the 3-gallon jug.

| S.No. |	Initial State	| Condition    |	Final state  |	Description of action taken                                          |
|-------|---------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.    |	(x,y)	        | If x<4	      | (4,y)	       | Fill the 4 gallon jug completely                                     |
| 2.    |	(x,y)         |	if y<3       |	(x,3)	       | Fill the 3 gallon jug completely                                     |
| 3.	   |(x,y)	         | If x>0	      | (x-d,y)	     | Pour some part from the 4 gallon jug                                 |
| 4.	   | (x,y)	        | If y>0	      | (x,y-d)	     | Pour some part from the 3 gallon jug                                 |
| 5.    |	(x,y)	        | If x>0	      | (0,y)	       | Empty the 4 gallon jug                                               |
| 6.	   |(x,y)	         | If y>0	      | (x,0)        |	Empty the 3 gallon jug                                               |
| 7.	   |(x,y)	         | If (x+y)<7	  | (4, y-[4-x])	| Pour some water from the 3 gallon jug to fill the four gallon jug    |
| 8.	   |(x,y)	         | If (x+y)<7	  | (x-[3-y],y)	 |Pour some water from the 4 gallon jug to fill the 3 gallon jug.       |
| 9.	   |(x,y)	         | If (x+y)<4	  | (x+y,0)	     |Pour all water from 3 gallon jug to the 4 gallon jug                  |
| 10.	  |(x,y)	         |if (x+y)<3	   | (0, x+y)	    |Pour all water from the 4 gallon jug to the 3 gallon jug              |


### Solution of water jug problem according to the production rules
|S.No.	| 4 gallon jug contents	| 3 gallon jug contents |	Rule followed |
|------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| 1.   |	0 gallon              |	0 gallon	             | Initial state |
| 2.   |	0 gallon              |	3 gallons	            | Rule no.2     |
| 3.   |	3 gallons	            | 0 gallon	             | Rule no. 9    |
| 4.   |	3 gallons	            | 3 gallons	            | Rule no. 2    |
| 5.   |	4 gallons	            | 2 gallons	            | Rule no. 7    |
| 6.   |	0 gallon	             | 2 gallons	            | Rule no. 5    |
| 7.   |	2 gallons	            | 0 gallon	             |Rule no. 9     |

On reaching the 7th attempt, we reach a state which is our goal state. Therefore, at this state, our problem is solved.
